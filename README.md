# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to detect credit card fraud using data science techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) from Kaggle. It contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with only 0.17% of the transactions being fraudulent.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to build a classification model that can accurately identify fraudulent credit card transactions based on various features such as transaction amount, time, and anonymized numerical features obtained from PCA transformation. By detecting fraud accurately, financial institutions can prevent potential losses and protect their customers from unauthorized transactions.

## Methodology

The project follows the following steps:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform data exploration and visualization to understand the distribution of features, identify any patterns or anomalies, and gain insights into the dataset.

2. Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, scaling numerical features, encoding categorical features (if any), and handling class imbalance (e.g., using oversampling or undersampling techniques).

3. Feature Selection/Engineering: Select relevant features based on their importance and correlation with the target variable. Create new features if necessary.

4. Model Development: Train and evaluate different machine learning models for fraud detection, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, or Gradient Boosting algorithms. Tune hyperparameters to optimize model performance.

5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Consider the trade-off between false positives and false negatives, as both types of errors are crucial in fraud detection.

6. Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model in a production environment or integrate it into an existing fraud detection system.
